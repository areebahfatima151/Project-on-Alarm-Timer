# Project-on-Alarm-Timer
This is a simple countdown alarm timer written in Python. It takes user input for minutes and seconds, displays a live countdown in the console, and plays a sound when the timer reaches zero.

**How it works:**
1. The user is prompted to enter the number of minutes and seconds for the countdown.
2. The program calculates the total time in seconds.
3. It enters a loop where it:
    Waits 1 second per iteration.
    Updates and prints the remaining time in MM:SS format on the same line.
4. Once the timer reaches zero, it displays a "Time's up!" message.
5. Finally, it plays an alarm sound.
